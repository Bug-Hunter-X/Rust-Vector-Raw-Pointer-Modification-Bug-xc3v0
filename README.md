This repository showcases a common error in Rust involving unsafe code and raw pointers. Modifying a vector's contents directly through its raw pointer can result in undefined behavior, such as data corruption or program crashes. The `bug.rs` file demonstrates the erroneous approach.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a safe and correct alternative using vector indexing or iterators.
